## Examples

### Basic info
This query allows you to gain insights into the basic information of attachments in a Linear project. It's useful when you need to quickly assess details like titles, subtitles, source types, creation and update dates, and URLs, which can help in managing and organizing project resources.

```sql+postgres
select
  id,
  title,
  subtitle,
  source_type,
  created_at,
  updated_at,
  url
from
  linear_attachment;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  id,
  title,
  subtitle,
  source_type,
  created_at,
  updated_at,
  url
from
  linear_attachment;
```

### List attachments where source type is unknown
Identify instances where attachments have an unknown source type. This can be useful in assessing potential data integrity issues or tracking unclassified data within your system.

```sql+postgres
select
  id,
  title,
  subtitle,
  source_type,
  created_at,
  updated_at,
  url
from
  linear_attachment
where
  source_type = 'unknown';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
